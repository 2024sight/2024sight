# 2024sight
I am a self-employed consultant/coder/system administrator & systems architect. I have a long standing interest in and experience with security/privacy/data preservation and retention issues. However, all my coding projects are either providing interfaces between systems or extending existing systems with new functionality whereby the default behaviour of the extended system typically does not change. I.e. the extended system can dropped in place of the original without side-effect. Access to new functionality needs to be explicitly enabled.
