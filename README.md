# 2024sight
I am a self-employed consultant/coder/system administrator & architect with a long standing interest in security/privacy issues. As far as coding goes I like developing interfaces between systems of just about any sort. I code in whatever language gets the job done most elegantly but if I have a choice, I would use Perl if it is halfway suitable.
